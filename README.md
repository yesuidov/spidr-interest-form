This React app features a custom interest form, designed for a hypothetical product launch by Spidr Design and is to be embedded at the bottom of its landing page. The interface is styled to reflect Spidrâ€™s brand identity, using a matching color scheme, typography, and interactive button effects found on the official [Spidr Design](https://spidr.design/) website.
